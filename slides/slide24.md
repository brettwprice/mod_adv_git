## The Development Process

With the new repository created, we can begin to actually code.  A couple of key points: 

* Development is a continuing cycle of **Code -> Add -> Commit -> Push**
* Keep the mantra "Commit early, commit often" in mind
    * Small commits preferred over large commits
* Commits can be seen as "undo points"
